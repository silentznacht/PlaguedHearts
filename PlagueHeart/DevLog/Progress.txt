Originally this game was called Grimore, I truly wanted to make this work
but sooner than later my interest grew stagnant. My passion for such a 
project was in decline, and so I aim to revive this project as PlaguedHearts.

I hate school, I wish I could be talented like the other developers, I wish 
I could just graduate already and just focus on doing things that are actually
impactful to my life, things I could genuinely enjoy while bettering the world.

Bug Fixes
    - KravenWares (menu invalid displays)
        - menu loop kept continuing
            - FIXED: break statement used to end loop move to following method
        - transaction handler invalidity (no item found error loop & insufficent funds)
            - adds sc.nextLine() above loop to consume line before jump
                - FUCKING BULLSHIT THAT BUG TOOK 3 FUCKING WEEKS JUST FOR ONE LINE FUCKING BULLSHIT TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE
                    - Only god knows what ever the fuck is going on in that shop file

Things Learned
    - PissinInn(customer change)
        - I was cnofused why customer dialogue was not being generated randomly, everytime the user wishes to answer a customer or use the mixbook
            - (ISSUE) I was using a variable and assigned the method generating dialogue onto the variable, meaning the value being returned in the method
              will instead be called once and assigned (non change), this is fixed by instead deleting the dead variable and calling the method instead on 
              output
